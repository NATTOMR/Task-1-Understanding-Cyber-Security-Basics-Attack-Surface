## 1️⃣ What is Cyber Security?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.

### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Prevents unauthorized access  
- **Integrity** – Prevents unauthorized data modification  
- **Availability** – Ensures services are accessible  

---

## 2️⃣ Types of Attackers
- Script Kiddies  
- Insiders  
- Hacktivists  
- Cyber Criminals  
- Nation-State Actors  

---

## 3️⃣ Attack Surfaces
An attack surface includes all points where an attacker can try to enter a system.

**Common attack surfaces:**
- Web Applications
- Mobile Applications
- APIs
- Networks
- Cloud Infrastructure

## 5️⃣ Mapping Applications to Attack Surfaces

| Application | Attack Examples |
|------------|----------------|
| Email | Phishing, Malware |
| WhatsApp | Account takeover |
| Banking Apps | API abuse |

### Possible Attack Points
- User side – Phishing
- Application – Injection, XSS
- Network – MITM
- Database – Data breach

---

## 7️⃣ Summary
Understanding cybersecurity concepts helps reduce risks and defend against cyber threats effectively.
